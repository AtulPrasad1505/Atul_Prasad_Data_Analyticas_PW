        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "  - (1) A function is a block of reusable code that takes input (arguments), processes them, and returns a result.\n",
        "   Functions are defined using the def keyword and can be called independently of any object.\n",
        "   (2) A method is a function that is associated with an object, meaning it is tied to an instance of a class or the class itself. Methods are used to perform actions using the data (attributes) that belong to that object or class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python?\n",
        "  - Function arguments and Parameters are essential concepts for passing data to functions so they can perform specific tasks.\n",
        "  (1) Parameters are the variables listed in the function definition. They act as placeholders that specify what kind of information the function expects to receive when it is called. A function can have multiple parameters, and they are defined inside the parentheses in the function signature. Parameters are variables in the function definition.\n",
        "  (2) Arguments are the actual values you pass to the function when calling it. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function.\n",
        "  Arguments can be provided in several ways: positional arguments, keyword arguments, default arguments, and variable-length arguments. Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, there are multiple ways to define and call functions, depending on the context and the specific needs of the program.\n",
        "  Basic function using def.\n",
        "  1-Function with parameters and arguments.\n",
        "  2-Function with default parameters.\n",
        "  3-Function with variable-length arguments (*args,**kwargs).\n",
        "  4-Lambda functions for anonymous, small functions.\n",
        "  5-Assigning functions to variables.\n",
        "  6-Nested functions (functions inside other functions).\n",
        "  7-Returning functions from functions (closures).\n",
        "  8-Recursive functions that call themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "  - The Return statement in a Python function is used to send a value back to the caller. Once a return statement is encountered, the function terminates.If no return is specified, the function returns None.If a function has multiple return statements, it will return as soon as the first one is encountered.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "  - An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It implements two special methods. __iter__() → Returns the iterator object itself and __next__() → Returns the next item in the sequence. If there are no more items, it raises a StopIteration exception. where as an iterable is any Python object that can be looped over (iterated). It has a special method __iter__() that returns an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined?\n",
        "  - Generators produce values one at a time and only when requested, making them memory-efficient. Unlike regular functions that reset every time they are called, generators remember their last execution state and resume from there when called again. Generators implement both __iter__() and __next__(), so they can be directly used in loops. Generators are defined using a function with yield instead of return.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "  - Generators provide several benefits, particularly when dealing with large datasets, streaming data, or memory-intensive tasks. Generators produce values one at a time, keeping memory usage low. Since generators compute values on demand, they start producing results immediately, unlike functions that return large lists. Generators can yield indefinitely, making them ideal for infinite sequences. Generators remember where they left off and resume execution from that point. Generaters are Memory efficient, faster Execution, Can Represent Infinite Sequences, Cleaner and More Readable Code.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "  - A lambda function also called an anonymous function it is a small, single-expression function that does not require a formal def statement. It is created using the lambda keyword. No return statement needed— the expression is automatically returned. Can take any number of arguments, but only one expression. syntax:lambda arguments: expression, Lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations where defining a full function would be unnecessary. Lambda can be used with map(), filter(), sorted().\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python?\n",
        "  - The map() function in Python applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) and returns an iterator i.e a map object with the transformed values. Syntax: map(function, iterable).\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "  -  1. map() : It apply a Function to Each Element,  Transforms each element of an iterable using a function. Returns a map object (iterator), which can be converted to a list. Does NOT change the number of elements in the original iterable. Use map() when you want to apply a function to every element in an iterable.\n",
        "      2. filter() – It select Elements Based on a Condition, Filters elements of an iterable based on a condition (boolean function). Returns only the elements that evaluate to True. The output may have fewer elements than the input. Use filter() when you need to remove elements that don’t meet a condition.\n",
        "      3. reduce() – Applies a function cumulatively to the elements of an iterable, reducing it to a single value. Unlike map() and filter(), reduce() is not built-in and must be imported from functools. Use reduce() when you need to combine all elements into a single value (e.g., sum, product, max).\n",
