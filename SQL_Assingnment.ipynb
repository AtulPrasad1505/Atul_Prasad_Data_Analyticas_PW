        "2. Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide examples of common types of constraints.\n",
        "  - Purpose of Constraints in Databases: Constraints are rules applied to database columns to enforce data integrity, accuracy, and consistency. They help ensure that the data entered into a database follows predefined rules and business logic, preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being stored. By doing so, constraints maintain the reliability and quality of data across the database system.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - How Constraints Help Maintain Data Integrity:\n",
        "  1. Prevent Invalid Data Entry: Constraints ensure only valid data is inserted into a table.\n",
        "  2. Enforce Relationships: They maintain logical connections between tables (e.g., foreign keys).\n",
        "  3. Ensure Uniqueness and Accuracy: By enforcing unique and required values where necessary.\n",
        "  4. Support Business Rules: They help implement real-world rules (e.g., prices can't be negative).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Eg : Not Null, UNIQUE, Primary Key, Forigen Key, Check, Default.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.\n",
        "  - The NOT NULL constraint is used to ensure that a column always contains a  value, i.e., it cannot be left empty (NULL). This is important when the column holds essential information that the database or application logic depends on.\n",
        "  - A primary key cannot contain NULL values.  A primary key must uniquely identify each row in a table. NULL represents an unknown or missing value, and allowing NULL would violate the principle of uniqueness. Primary keys are often used in joins and references (foreign keys), and NULLs would break referential integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Primary keys are often used in joins and references (foreign keys), and NULLs would break referential integrity.\n",
        "  - Primary keys are used to uniquely identify each record in a table, and foreign keys refer to those primary keys to create relationships between tables. If a primary key were allowed to be NULL, it would introduce uncertainty—because NULL means \"unknown,\" it cannot reliably serve as a unique identifier.\n",
        "  In terms of referential integrity, this causes problems because:\n",
        "  A foreign key referencing a NULL primary key would have no clear match.\n",
        "  You couldn't enforce that all foreign keys actually point to valid, existing records.\n",
        "  - Example : Create the Departments table -\n",
        "    CREATE TABLE Departments (DepartmentID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "    Name VARCHAR(100));\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Example : Create the Employees table with a foreign key referencing Departments - CREATE TABLE Employees (EmployeeID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "    DepartmentID INT, FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID));\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints. Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.\n",
        "  - Attempting to insert, update, or delete data that violates constraints in a database leads to errors that prevent the operation from being completed. These constraints are enforced to maintain data integrity, and violations typically result in immediate failure of the SQL statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Consequences of Violating Constraints:\n",
        "  1. INSERT Violations:\n",
        "  Occur when you try to insert a row that doesn’t meet the constraint rules.\n",
        "  Example: Inserting a NULL into a NOT NULL column or a duplicate value into a UNIQUE column.\n",
        "  - ERROR 1048 (23000): Column 'EmployeeID' cannot be null\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. UPDATE Violations:\n",
        " Happen when an update causes the new data to violate constraints.\n",
        "Example: Changing a foreign key value to one that doesn't exist in the referenced table.\n",
        "  - ERROR 1452 (23000): Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails\n",
        "(`your_db`.`Employees`, CONSTRAINT `Employees_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`DepartmentID`)\n",
        "REFERENCES `Departments` (`DepartmentID`))\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. DELETE Violations: If you try to delete a record that is being referenced by a foreign key, and cascading is not enabled, the delete will fail.\n",
        "  Example: Deleting a department that still has employees linked to it.\n",
        "  - ERROR 1451 (23000): Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails\n",
        "(`your_db`.`Employees`, CONSTRAINT `Employees_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`DepartmentID`)\n",

        "The product_id should be a primary key,\n",
